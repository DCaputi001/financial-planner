<!--
  Component: Verification Page Template
  Purpose:
    This interface is used during the multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    process. After a user logs in, they are required to enter the
    verification code sent to their email. This template displays the
    email being verified, provides an input field for the code, and
    triggers the component's onVerify() method.

  Key Features:
    - Displays the user's pending email for clarity.
    - Two-way binding for the verification code input via ngModel.
    - Clean layout with a feedback message for success or error states.
